            "content_html": "<p><a href=\"http://www.digitaltrends.com/home/ge-firstbuild-monogram-pizza-oven/\">Digital Trends</a>: </p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>&quot;But now you too can own an oven hot enough to make Satan sweat. GE’s elite FirstBuild team just unveiled the Monogram Pizza Oven, which can not only hit the same temperatures as the scorcher your local pizzeria uses, it’s a lot smarter, too.\n<br/><br/>\n&quot;This isn’t another one of those backyard, wood-fired pizza ovens that have been gaining popularity over the past few years as home pizza making takes off. The Monogram Pizza Oven installs right in your kitchen and uses a standard 240-volt outlet, with no special venting required, unlike a commercial unit. But you won’t mistake it for an ordinary kitchen oven. The short height and conspicuous lack of a door are a dead giveaway you’re dealing with a culinary dragon.&quot;</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I don&#39;t understand how an oven like this gets made. The reason why traditional wood fired ovens don&#39;t have a door is because you need a steady flow of oxygen to feed the fire. You put a door on an electric oven to keep the heat and moisture in.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>&quot;The Monogram can blast to 800 degrees within a half hour of preheating, and 14 heating elements in the dome can rocket the top up to a blistering 1,200 degrees. Those conditions, it turns out, are exactly what you need to bake a perfect Neapolitan-style pizza … in two minutes flat.&quot;</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>If you&#39;re taking two minutes to bake a Neapolitan pizza in an oven that goes to 1.2k, then something is seriously wrong with your oven. I&#39;ve baked at 1.2k before, and it&#39;s insanely difficult. Your pizza is going to cook in about 45 seconds and unless you have everything dialed you&#39;re going to have a pizza that&#39;s burnt on the outside with raw dough on the inside.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.digitaltrends.com/home/ge-monogram-pizza-oven-taste-test/\">From another page</a> on Digital Trends where they try out pizzas made in the oven:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>&quot;Each slice was crispy on the outside, still chewy inside, with just a hint of crumbly black char around the edges — an effect I’ve never been able to replicate in my home oven.&quot;</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Neapolitan pizza is supposed to be soft, not crispy. Crispy is what happens when you bake too long and use the wrong flour. Looking at the pizzas made in the GE oven and the burnt edges where there should be leoparding, I&#39;m guessing these were 2-3 minute pies.</p>\n<p>Here&#39;s what a proper neo pizza should look like:</p>\n<center>\n<img src=\"https://instagram.fsnc1-1.fna.fbcdn.net/hphotos-xpa1/t51.2885-15/s640x640/sh0.08/e35/12547241_1036741646346643_1720954828_n.jpg\" style=\"border: solid 1px #000;\" width=\"320\" height=\"320\" /><br/>\n(Photo from <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/pizzicletta/\">@pizzicletta&#39;s</a> Instagram page)\n</center>\n\n<p>From the previous page:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>&quot;But can anything top the satisfaction of making your own pizza at home? Or more importantly, watching your personal chef make it for you?&quot;</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>At $10,000 USD, I guess this is for people with more money than sense. If you&#39;re going to get an electric oven for baking neapolitan at home, you&#39;re probably better off getting a <a href=\"https://www.google.com/search?client=safari&amp;rls=en&amp;q=cuppone+tiziano&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;oe=UTF-8\">Cuppone Tiziano</a> or a <a href=\"https://www.google.com/search?client=safari&amp;rls=en&amp;q=Effeuno+P134H&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;oe=UTF-8\">Effeuno P134H</a> if you live in Europe (you lucky jerks).</p>\n<p>Found via <a href=\"http://www.pizzamaking.com/forum/index.php?topic=41271.0\">Pizza Making</a>.</p>\n",

So here you go:</p>\n<p><strong><a href=\"http://www.zerozerosf.com/\">Zero Zero</a></strong>. Located just a couple of blocks away from the Moscone Center where WWDC is hosted. It&#39;s open late, has a nice bar, and the quality of the pizza is pretty consistent.</p>\n<p>It&#39;s a little pricy and can get crowded, but it&#39;s good pie.</p>\n<p><strong><a href=\"http://tonyspizzanapoletana.com\">Tony’s Pizza Napoletana</a></strong>. A bit of a hike from WWDC, but if you&#39;re a pizza aficionado, you absolutely need to go here. The (PDF) <a href=\"http://tonyspizzanapoletana.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/TonysPizzaNapoletana_Menu-12162015.pdf\">menu is astounding</a>. Ten different styles of pizzas, from Neapolitan to St. Louis to Detroit and even Coal Fired. WTF, how many ovens do they have? Who even does this? <a href=\"http://maybepizza.com/assets/THIS_IS_AMAZING.mp3\">THIS IS AMAZING</a>. My brain just about exploded the first time I saw their menu.</p>\n<p><strong><a href=\"https://www.google.com/search?client=safari&amp;rls=en&amp;q=una+pizza+napoletana&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;oe=UTF-8\">Una Pizza Napoletana</a></strong>. Famous for being Una Pizza Napoletana, this restaurant is another must for the pizza aficionado. Actually, I&#39;d say it&#39;s more of a pilgrimage (though a short one at a 25 minute walk from Moscone Center). The resident pizzaiolo, Anthony Mangieri, is widely credited for helping start the US Neapolitan craze. Check out their <a href=\"http://www.unapizza.com/home\">videos page</a> for a taste (and scroll right to start with the last video, working forward after that).</p>\n<p>It&#39;s a bit pricy, and can be a bit wet. I recommend the Filetti.</p>\n<p><strong><a href=\"http://www.delpopolosf.com\">Del Popolo</a></strong>. This is currently my favorite Neapolitan pizza in all the universe. And since I&#39;ve last had it they&#39;ve opened up a brick store, which means you now have two locations to grab a pie from.</p>\n<p>Del Popolo (aka, Jon Darsky) is mostly known because they took a flippen&#39; giant shipping container, <a href=\"http://www.psfk.com/2012/07/shipping-container-gets-converted-into-a-wood-fired-pizza-oven-food-truck.html\">stuck it it on a big truck</a>, put a Stefano Ferrara pizza oven in there, and made it look pretty. And that pizza truck usually shows up a block or two away at Mint Plaza during WWDC.</p>\n<p>The prices for the pizza truck are very reasonable, and I recommend everything.</p>\n<p>I haven&#39;t been to the restaurant on Bush Street yet, but my hotel is a few blocks away, so you bet I will. Most likely more than once.</p>\n<p>…</p>\n<p>I hope this year to expand my horizons a bit more and try out some new places. Got any recommendations for me? Delfina and PizzaHacker are already on the list.</p>\n",

A couple of days before, I had mixed together flour and water into a paste. But now pockets of gas percolated through that seemingly inert glob. It was breathing. It was alive.</p>\n<p>&quot;This gloppy mess, exuding a whiff of vinegar, was my nascent sourdough starter. When mature, it would be a pungent brew of yeasts and bacteria, a complex ecosystem that would hopefully yield delicious loaves of sourdough bread.</p>\n<p>&quot;As the microbes eat the sugars in the flour, they exhale carbon dioxide, producing the bubbles that turn a flat, dense loaf into something light and fluffy. A starter breathes life into bread. If the loaf is the body, the starter is the soul.&quot;</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Over the years I&#39;ve attempted to use starters for my pizza dough, without any success. I could get <a href=\"http://amzn.to/2ejagmW\">various starters</a> going but the flavor it invoked just wasn&#39;t something I liked.</p>\n<p>That changed this past summer, after chatting with some folks at the <a href=\"http://www.delpopolosf.com/truck\">Del Popolo pizza truck</a>. I asked if they added any yeast to their starter to help things out, and the answer was no. Do they sell it? Again the answer was no. But the guy in the truck offered some more information- the Del Popolo starter was super active, and they fed it 4 times a day.</p>\n<p>Four. Times. A. Day.</p>\n<p>That&#39;s a lot. I knew that frequently feeding your starter would make it less sour, but … four times a day. That&#39;s commitment.</p>\n<p>So when I returned home from my trip, I made a new starter, and I fed it. A lot. It became super active, and I was soon feeding it 3-4 times a day.</p>\n<p>And I knew the temperature it lived in would change which microbes became more active, so bought a little round thermos from a thrift store, a <a href=\"http://amzn.to/2fwsMps\">temperature controller</a>, and stuck a seedling heat mat in there.</p>\n<center><img class=\"bb\" src=\"http://maybepizza.com//images/2016/startertherm.jpg\" alt=\"My starter contraption.\"  width=\"660\" /><div style=\"color: #666; padding-top: 2px;\">My starter contraption.</div></center>\n\n<p>Pretty soon I had a starter with really good flavor and very little sour to it. And for the past 6 months or so, I&#39;ve been using using it in my pizzas.</p>\n<p>At first I would just add 1-2% as a flavoring agent in addition to the normal yeast amounts. Then I started ramping up the amount of starter I&#39;d use to 10% and even pushing it up to 20% at times.</p>\n<p>I&#39;d try experimenting by not adding any yeast, or maybe just a tiny bit. I&#39;m still learning what the best ratios are, and even what temperature I keep the active starter at. This past weekend had it a 84 degrees, 10% starter, and 1/4 teaspoon of yeast for six dough balls (it turned out pretty awesome).</p>\n<p>I have a whole routine I use to store and swap out older starter that goes dormant in the fridge, and what I do to re-train it to get it ready for pizza on the weekend. I&#39;ll probably go into detail about that some day in the future, but the takeaway from this post is: if you haven&#39;t been happy with starter in the past, maybe try again? And do everything in your power to keep your starter in a stable environment so things like feeding schedules and temperatures don&#39;t throw everything off?</p>\n<p>It&#39;s nice having a new area to explore with my pizza making. And my starter&#39;s name? &quot;Magic&quot;.</p>\n",

There were a couple times when, propelled into a fit of rage, pizza peel thrown across the room, tomato sauce splattered against the kitchen floor, we honestly regretted ever even trying to make homemade pizza. The failure of a single pie extended to our entire existence. \n\nWhat is it about the simple act of dropping a pizza that can cause an existential crisis? \n\nAQ had a particularly harrowing encounter with imperfection. He carefully made the dough, waited patiently for several days, did all the necessary prep work, and had a plan for a perfect meal. Then disaster struck: the pizza ended up lying half-folded over on the black and white checkered kitchen tile, and all of AQs hopes for success collapsed into that half-baked mozzarella inferno. Disappointment wasn't the root feeling. The inability to conquer the making of a simple pizza somehow was a sign of a deeper intrinsic weakness. He thought: \"I am a failure:' \n\nSo AQ got angry. He started yelling, throwing his hands up, and tossing his tools around. He was angry at his own feelings of inadequacy, but he blamed those feelings on everyone and everything around him. \n\nIt took a while to recover and make pizza again, but the urge to try crept back and the next time AQ made pizza it came out better. \n\nThat wasn't the last time either of us screwed up. Over the past eight years it's happened more times than we would like to admit, and it even happened while we made the pizzas for the photos in this book. \n\nWhat we learned along the way is that messing up is not actually a sign that we are shitty bakers (or worse). These incidents are reminders that sometimes you fail (we're guessing that people who play competitive sports as kids learn this lesson sooner, but we will admit that we were more indoor kids). Failure isn't something that you need to con-quer and \"defeat,\" rather failure is part of being successful at whatever you're trying to do, especially when there are many variables involved beyond your control. \n\nOver time our pizza disasters have become fewer and far between. Practice makes us better. Our higher success rates stem from observation. We've learned to document every detail of the process. Our goal is to try to share as many of those details with you, but we know your pizza making success will come from becoming aware of all of the subtle aspects of the craft. You're going to fail at least a couple of times no matter what, and we're here to tell you that not only is that OK but it means you're on your way to learning more. \n\nEnough with being sappy, let's go make some pizza. \n-->",

I found the workflow of mixing old starter with 50% water, shaking everything up quite a bit so it&#39;s as above, and then stirring in my 50% flour to be a cleaner process. It also more evenly distributes the older starter among the new flour. Turns out it&#39;s also a great process for making dough.</p>\n<p>OK, onto the second tip.</p>\n<center><img class=\"bb\" src=\"http://maybepizza.com//images/2017/01/rubbermaid.jpg\" alt=\"\"  width=\"660\" /><div style=\"color: #666; padding-top: 2px;\"></div></center>\n\n<p>I found when <a href=\"http://maybepizza.com/archives/2016/11/another_new_pizza_oven.html\">hacking up my new oven</a> that it was annoying to make pizza dough every other night when I wanted to test something out. Especially since I only wanted one or two pies for my tests.</p>\n<p>Now, this isn&#39;t exactly new information (sorry). You can make your dough ahead of time, ball it up, put it slightly oiled <a href=\"http://amzn.to/2hMrV6N\">containers</a> (as seen above), then you can have &quot;overnight&quot; dough or even keep it a week or a bit more in the fridge. If you want to have pizza later on, you&#39;ll take your dough out ~12 hours ahead of time to give it ample time to warm up, activate, and raise. Then you get to have pizza. Yum.</p>\n<p>OK now here&#39;s the new information.</p>\n<p>Small containers are awesome if you don&#39;t have a lot of room in your fridge, but it can complicate things when raising. You&#39;ll notice in the above images that there isn&#39;t much room for the dough to expand. In fact, if you try to do that with the lids on, then you&#39;re going to blow them right off (because of expansion of the gas in the dough) and if you&#39;re not around to catch that, you&#39;re going to have funky dry dough.</p>\n<p>Nobody likes funky dry dough.</p>\n<p>Instead, you&#39;ll need to transfer it into a larger container or do something like this:</p>\n<center><img class=\"bb\" src=\"http://maybepizza.com//images/2017/01/containers_in_containers.jpg\" alt=\"Containers in containers\"  width=\"660\" /><div style=\"color: #666; padding-top: 2px;\">Containers in containers</div></center>\n\n<p>Since there&#39;s more room for expansion, and the lid of the outer container isn&#39;t super tight- things aren&#39;t going to explode and dry out.</p>\n<p>But wait there&#39;s more.</p>\n<p>Using the above technique, and using starter, I&#39;ve found that I can even go 3 to 4 weeks with this dough in the fridge (this may or may not work with active dry yeast). But that 12 hour planning ahead kind of sucks. What if I&#39;m really really hungry and I want that pizza an hour or two after removing it from the fridge?</p>\n<p>This takes a bit more planning, but it&#39;s doable. Let your dough raise as described above, and still in the little container. Let it double in size so it raises just to the top of your smaller container, and then put the lid back on and shove it in the fridge.</p>\n<p>When cooling down in the fridge, you&#39;re stopping (or slowing down by a lot) the activity which was raising your dough. It&#39;s frozen in time, just about ready to be put in the oven.</p>\n<p>Then when future you is hungry you can pull your raised dough out of the fridge and just let it warm up. It&#39;ll still turn out great. Here&#39;s an example <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/BOvWpFdBgLz/?taken-by=ccgus\">pie made just that way</a>.</p>\n<p>That&#39;s it! Except- Happy New Year. Let&#39;s make a lot of pizza in 2017.</p>\n",

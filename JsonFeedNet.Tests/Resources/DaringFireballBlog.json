Works\nfine. Easy to use. Like most of us who spend too much time in\nfront of a laptop, I have two browsers open; Firefox for work,\nChrome for play, customized settings for each. There are multiple\nthings that bug me about the Chrome product, for sure, but I‘m OK\nwith Chrome. I just don’t like <em>only</em> being on Chrome. [&#8230;]</p>\n\n<p>But talking to friends, it sounds more and more like living on\nChrome has started to feel like their only option. Edge is broken.\nSafari and Internet Explorer are just plain bad. And\nunfortunately, too many people think Firefox isn’t a modern\nalternative.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>In an update posted today, he walked that back:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>In my original post I made a personal dig about Edge, IE and\nSafari: “Edge is broken. Safari and Internet Explorer are just\nplain bad.” I’ve since deleted that sentence.</p>\n\n<p>It’s true, I personally don’t like those products, they just don’t\nwork for me. But that was probably a bit too flip. And, if it\nwasn’t obvious that those were my personal opinions as a user, not\nthose of the good folks at Firefox and Mozilla, then please accept\nmy apology.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>It&#8217;s easy when making an aside &#8212; and it&#8217;s clear that the central premise of this piece is about positioning Chrome as the Goliath to Firefox&#8217;s David, so references to Safari and IE are clearly asides &#8212; to conflate &#8220;<em>I don&#8217;t like X</em>&#8221; with &#8220;<em>X is bad</em>&#8221;. So I say we let it slide.<sup id=\"fnr1-2017-05-24\"><a href=\"#fn1-2017-05-24\">1</a></sup></p>\n\n<p>But I&#8217;ve been meaning to write about Safari vs. Chrome for a while, and Petitt&#8217;s jab, even retracted, makes for a good excuse.</p>\n\n<p>I think Safari is a <em>terrific</em> browser. It remains the one and only browser for the Mac that behaves like a native Mac app through and through. It may not be the fastest browser but it is fast. And its energy performance puts Chrome to shame. If you use a Mac laptop, using Chrome instead of Safari can cost you an hour or more of battery life per day.<sup id=\"fnr2-2017-05-24\"><a href=\"#fn2-2017-05-24\">2</a></sup></p>\n\n<p>But Chrome is a terrific browser, too. It&#8217;s clearly the second-most-Mac-like browser for MacOS. It almost inarguably has the widest and deepest extension ecosystem. It has good web developer tools, and Chrome adopts new web development technologies faster than Safari does.</p>\n\n<p>But Safari&#8217;s extension model is more privacy-conscious. For many people on MacOS, the decision between Safari and Chrome probably comes down which ecosystem you&#8217;re more invested in &#8212; iCloud or Google &#8212; for things like tab, bookmark, and history syncing. Me, personally, I&#8217;d feel lost without the ability to send tabs between my Macs and iPhone via Continuity.</p>\n\n<p>In short, Safari closely reflects Apple&#8217;s institutional priorities (privacy, energy efficiency, the niceness of the native UI, support for MacOS and iCloud technologies) and Chrome closely reflects Google&#8217;s priorities (speed, convenience, a web-centric rather than native-app-centric concept of desktop computing, integration with Google web properties). Safari is Apple&#8217;s browser for Apple devices. Chrome is Google&#8217;s browser for all devices.</p>\n\n<p>I personally prefer Safari, but I can totally see why others &#8212; especially those who work on desktop machines or MacBooks that are usually plugged into power &#8212; prefer Chrome. DF readers agree. Looking at my web stats, over the last 30 days, 69 percent of Mac users visiting DF used Safari, but a sizable 28 percent used Chrome. (Firefox came in at 3 percent, and everything else was under 1 percent.)<sup id=\"fnr3-2017-05-24\"><a href=\"#fn3-2017-05-24\">3</a></sup></p>\n\n<p>As someone who&#8217;s been a Mac user long enough to remember when there were <em>no</em> good web browsers for the Mac, having both Safari and Chrome feels downright bountiful, and the competition is making both of them better.</p>\n\n<div class=\"footnotes\">\n<hr />\n<ol>\n<li id=\"fn1-2017-05-24\">\n<p>What really struck me about Petitt&#8217;s piece wasn&#8217;t the unfounded (to my eyes) dismissal of Safari, but rather his admission that he uses &#8220;Firefox for work,  Chrome for play&#8221;. I really doubt the marketing managers for Chrome or Safari spend their days with a rival browser open for &#8220;play&#8221;, and even if they did, I expect they&#8217;d have the common sense not to admit so publicly, and especially not in the opening paragraph of a piece arguing that their own browser is a viable alternative to the rival one.&nbsp;<a href=\"#fnr1-2017-05-24\"  class=\"footnoteBackLink\"  title=\"Jump back to footnote 1 in the text.\">&#x21A9;&#xFE0E;</a></p>\n</li>\n<li id=\"fn2-2017-05-24\">\n<p>Back in December, when Consumer Reports rushed out their sensational report <a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2016/12/23/cr-mbp\">claiming bizarrely erratic battery life</a> on the then-new MacBook Pros (which was eventually determined to be <a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2017/01/12/consumer-reports\">caused by a bug in Safari that Apple soon fixed</a>), I decided to try to loosely replicate their test on the MacBook Pro review units I had from Apple. Consumer Reports doesn&#8217;t reveal the exact details of their testing, but they do describe it in general. They set the laptop brightness to a certain brightness value, then load a list of web pages repeatedly until the battery runs out. Presumably they automate this with a script of some sort, but they don&#8217;t say.</p>\n\n<p>That&#8217;s pretty easy to replicate in AppleScript. I used that day&#8217;s leading stories on <a href=\"https://www.techmeme.com/\">TechMeme</a> as my source for URLs to load &#8212; 26 URLs total. When a page loads, my script waits 5 seconds, and then scrolls down (simulating the Page Down key), waits another 5 seconds and pages down again, and then waits another 5 seconds before paging down one last time. This is a simple simulation of a person actually reading a web page. While running through the list of URLs, my script leaves each URL open in a tab. At the end of the list, it closes all tabs and then starts all over again. Each time through the loop the elapsed time and remaining battery life are logged to a file. (I also logged results as updates via messages sent to myself via iMessage, so I could monitor the progress of the hours-long test runs from my phone. No apps were running during the tests other than Safari, Script Editor, Finder, and Messages.)</p>\n\n<p>I set the display brightness at exactly 68.75 percent for each test (11/16 clicks on the brightness meter when using the function key buttons to adjust), a value I chose arbitrarily as a reasonable balance for someone running on battery power.</p>\n\n<p>Averaged (and rounded) across several runs, I got the following results:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>15-inch MacBook Pro With Touch Bar: 6h:50m</li>\n<li>13-inch MacBook Pro With Touch Bar: 5h:30m</li>\n<li>13-inch MacBook Pro (2014): 5h:10m</li>\n<li>11-inch MacBook Air (2011): 2h:15m</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>I no longer had a new 13-inch MacBook Pro without the Touch Bar (a.k.a. the &#8220;MacBook Esc&#8221;) &#8212; I&#8217;d sent it back to Apple. I included my own personal 2014 13-inch MacBook Pro and my old 2011 MacBook Air just as points of reference. I think the Air did poorly just because it was so old and so well-used. It still has its original battery.</p>\n\n<p>I saw <em>no</em> erratic fluctuations in battery life across runs of the test. I procrastinated on publishing the results, though, and within a few weeks the whole thing was written off with a &#8220;<em>never mind!</em>&#8221; when Apple fixed the bug in Safari that was causing Consumer Reports&#8217;s erratic results.</p>\n\n<p>Anyway, the whole point of including these results in this footnote is that I also ran the exact same test with Chrome on the 13-inch MacBook Pro With Touch Bar. The average result: 3h:40m. That&#8217;s 1h:50m difference. On the exact same machine running the exact same test with the exact same list of URLs, the battery lasted almost exactly 1.5 times as long using Safari than Chrome.</p>\n\n<p>My test was in no way meant to simulate real-world usage. You&#8217;d have to be fueled up on some serious stimulants to read a new web page every 15 seconds non-stop for hours on end. But the results were striking. If you place a high priority on your MacBook&#8217;s battery life, you should use Safari instead of Chrome.</p>\n\n<p>If you&#8217;re interested, I&#8217;ve posted my battery testing scripts for <a href=\"https://gist.github.com/gruber/ad201668b31d21096456d7abf11acbd3\">Safari</a> and <a href=\"https://gist.github.com/gruber/15d7183f04c2ac1c51ee6a2637925ebd\">Chrome</a>.&nbsp;<a href=\"#fnr2-2017-05-24\"  class=\"footnoteBackLink\"  title=\"Jump back to footnote 2 in the text.\">&#x21A9;&#xFE0E;︎</a></p>\n</li>\n<li id=\"fn3-2017-05-24\">\n<p>If anyone has a good source for browser usage by MacOS users from a general purpose website like The New York Times or CNN, let me know. I honestly don&#8217;t know whether to expect that the split among DF readers is biased in favor of Safari because DF readers are more likely to care about the advantages of a native app, or biased in favor of Chrome because so many of you are web developers or even just nerdy enough to install a third-party browser in the first place. Wikimedia used to publish stats like that, but alas, <a href=\"https://stats.wikimedia.org/wikimedia/squids/SquidReportClients.htm\">ceased in 2015</a>.&nbsp;<a href=\"#fnr3-2017-05-24\"  class=\"footnoteBackLink\"  title=\"Jump back to footnote 3 in the text.\">&#x21A9;&#xFE0E;︎</a></p>\n</li>\n\n</ol>\n</div>\n\n\n\n    "

Working in JSON is comfortable and familiar &#8212; the\ntools are good and you get told when something goes wrong. Working\nwith XML can be unclear and a bit of a pain, and creating an\ninvalid document is a risk.</p>\n\n<p>So my super-duper advanced JSON Feed implementation is…\nconstructing a <code>dict</code>, adding things to it and passing it off to\nthe JSON module that I use <em>all the time</em>. Taken care of.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>I do something similar to what Wells and Drang do. DF&#8217;s RSS and Atom XML feeds are generated via templates: skeleton XML documents with tokens and loop constructs where the actual content gets filled in. But for JSON Feed I just build a Perl data structure that maps exactly to the JSON Feed spec, and just call a single function from the standard JSON module and it gets printed. That&#8217;s it. A template would add complexity.</p>\n\n<div>\n<a  title=\"Permanent link to ‘Implementing JSON Feed’\"  href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2017/05/23/json-feed-dr-drang\">&nbsp;★&nbsp;</a>\n</div>\n\n\t"

And there’s nothing extra you have to do. This means if a\nwebsite syndicates their stories with the easy-to-write and\neasy-to-read JSON format, you can read it on NewsBlur. It should\nmake no difference to you, since you’re reading the end product.\nBut to website developers everywhere, supporting JSON Feeds is so\nmuch easier than supporting XML-based RSS/Atom.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>According to Clay, there are 15,000 NewsBlur users who subscribe to Daring Fireball. It&#8217;s very cool to see a feed reader that popular adopt JSON Feed so quickly.</p>\n\n<p>The DF RSS feed isn&#8217;t going anywhere, so if you&#8217;re already subscribed to it, there&#8217;s no need to switch. But JSON Feed&#8217;s spec makes it possible for me to specify both a <code>url</code> that points to the post on Daring Fireball (i.e. the permalink) and an <code>external_url</code> that points to the article I&#8217;m linking to. The way I&#8217;ve dealt with that in the RSS (technically Atom, but that&#8217;s sort of beside the point) is a bit of a hack that&#8217;s caused problems with numerous feed readers over the years.</p>\n\n<div>\n<a  title=\"Permanent link to ‘NewsBlur Now Supports JSON Feed’\"  href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2017/05/23/newsblur-json-feed\">&nbsp;★&nbsp;</a>\n</div>\n\n\t"

And\nhe did it on skis.&#8221;</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_kyQauA2udc\">That opening scene in <em>The Spy Who Loved Me</em></a> is also the one <a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/2015/04/watch_apple_watch\">where Bond is wearing a digital Seiko watch</a> that can receive secure text messages from MI6 &#8212; at the time, sheer fantasy; today, a feature many of you reading this now have on your own watch. (Albeit without the ticker tape.)</p>\n\n<p>I don&#8217;t know if it&#8217;s the single best Bond <em>scene</em> of all time, but it&#8217;s up there, and it&#8217;s almost certainly the best Bond <em>stunt</em> of all time &#8212; stuntman <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rick_Sylvester\">Rick Sylvester</a> actually skied off that cliff and parachuted to safety. I just love how the fall takes place in silence.</p>\n\n<p>Without hesitation I would put <em>The Spy Who Loved Me</em> at the top of my list of Roger Moore&#8217;s Bond films. It has everything: the aforementioned great opening, an iconic car (the submarine-convertible white Lotus Esprit<sup id=\"fnr1-2017-05-23\"><a href=\"#fn1-2017-05-23\">1</a></sup>), a great villian (Jaws), and a perfect theme song (Carly Simon&#8217;s &#8220;Nobody Does It Better&#8221;). Bernard Lee was still in the role as M. And at the center of it all, Roger Moore at his cool, suave, and assured best.</p>\n\n<p>Moore was quite self-aware of what he brought to the role. His take, <a href=\"http://www.npr.org/2014/11/15/364077265/roger-moore-the-man-with-the-golden-life\">in a 2014 interview with NPR</a>, is exactly right:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>I look like a comedic lover, and Sean [Connery] in particular, and\nDaniel Craig now, they are killers.

We asked to make the scroll inertia for that\ncase the same as the normal scrolling.</p>\n\n<p>Apple&#8217;s response was (surprisingly) to make the default scrolling\nlike the overflow scrolling. So, with the next Safari release all\npages will scroll like AMP pages. Hope Gruber is happy then :)</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>&#8220;Om2&#8221;, who seemingly works on WebKit for Apple <a href=\"https://trac.webkit.org/changeset/211197/webkit\">added</a>:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>In current iOS Safari, webpage scrolling is inconsistent from all\nother scrolling on the system. This was an intentional decision\nmade long ago. In addition, overflow areas are consistent with the\nrest of the system, and thus inconsistent with top-level webpage\nscrolling. This is semi-accidental. In reviewing scroll rates, we\nconcluded that the original reason was no longer a good tradeoff.\nThus this change, which removed all the inconsistencies:\n<a href=\"https://trac.webkit.org/changeset/211197/webkit\">https://trac.webkit.org/changeset/211197/webkit</a></p>\n\n<p>Having all scrolling be consistent feels good once you get\nused to it.</p>\n\n<p>That doesn&#8217;t necessarily mean it was a good idea for Google&#8217;s\nhosted AMP pages to use overflow scroll all along. The\ninconsistency definitely did feel weird. And the way they do\nscrolling prevents Safari from auto-hiding its top and bottom\nbars. I believe all the desired scroll effects could have been\nachieved without the use of overflow scroll.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>That&#8217;s a pretty big change, but I&#8217;ll bet Om2 is right that it soon feels normal. Web views have had different scrolling inertia than other scrolling views ever since the original iPhone. (My beef with scrolling in AMP is not that AMP&#8217;s fast scrolling is bad and Mobile Safari&#8217;s current slower scrolling is good, but rather that scrolling in AMP pages should not feel totally different than regular web pages. And I forgot to complain about the fact that AMP&#8217;s weird implementation also breaks Mobile Safari&#8217;s ability to hide the bottom and top browser chrome toolbars. <strong>Update:</strong> One more complaint: AMP breaks Safari&#8217;s Reader mode.)</p>\n\n<div>\n<a  title=\"Permanent link to ‘Scrolling Is Going to Change in Mobile Safari’\"  href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2017/05/22/mobile-safari-scrolling\">&nbsp;★&nbsp;</a>\n</div>\n\n\t"

If these devices wouldn&#8217;t start suddenly and incessantly\nbeeping, strangers wouldn&#8217;t lecture us to turn off our &#8220;cell\nphones&#8221; at the movie theater.</p>\n\n<p>In short, medical device manufacturers are stuck in a bygone era;\nthey continue to design these products in an engineering-driven,\nphysician-centered bubble. They have not yet grasped the concept\nthat medical devices are also life devices, and therefore need to\nfeel good and look good for the patients using them 24/7, in\naddition to keeping us alive.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>(<a href=\"http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2010-10-22/features/sc-health-1020-diabetes-insulin-devic20101022_1_insulin-dependent-diabetics-high-blood-glucose-levels-blood-sugar\">Follow-up here in 2010</a>.)</p>\n\n<p>This was incredibly prescient, given the rumors <a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2017/05/18/apple-watch-glucose\">that Apple is working on continuous non-invasive glucose monitoring</a> for Apple Watch. Jobs didn&#8217;t live to see it, but I think it&#8217;s exactly the sort of thing he would be pushing for if he were still alive.</p>\n\n<p>From chapter 37 of <a href=\"https://itun.es/us/QyFUz.l\">Walter Isaacson&#8217;s <em>Steve Jobs</em></a>:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Even when he was barely conscious, his strong personality came\nthrough. At one point the pulmonologist tried to put a mask over\nhis face when he was deeply sedated. Jobs ripped it off and\nmumbled that he hated the design and refused to wear it. Though\nbarely able to speak, he ordered them to bring five different\noptions for the mask and he would pick a design he liked. The\ndoctors looked at Powell, puzzled. She was finally able to\ndistract him so they could put on the mask. He also hated the\noxygen monitor they put on his finger. He told them it was ugly\nand too complex. He suggested ways it could be designed more\nsimply. “He was very attuned to every nuance of the environment\nand objects around him, and that drained him,” Powell recalled.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<div>\n<a  title=\"Permanent link to ‘10-Year-Old Open Letter Calling for Apple to Make Glucose Monitors’\"  href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2017/05/20/open-letter-apple-glucose\">&nbsp;★&nbsp;</a>\n</div>\n\n\t"

Google AMP is bad news\nfor how the web is built, it&#8217;s bad news for publishers of credible\nonline content, and it&#8217;s bad news for consumers of that content.\nGoogle AMP is only good for one party: Google. Google, and\npossibly, purveyors of fake news.</p>\n\n<p>It&#8217;s time for developers to wake up and, as Jason Scott <a href=\"http://ascii.textfiles.com/archives/3086\">once said</a>\nof Facebook, stop: &#8220;Shoveling down the shit sherbet&#8221; Google is now\nserving with AMP.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://daringfireball.net/linked/2017/01/17/schreiber-amp\">I&#8217;m on the record</a> as being strongly opposed to AMP simply on the grounds of publication independence. I&#8217;d stand by that even if the implementation were great. But the implementation is not great &#8212; it&#8217;s terrible. Yes, AMP pages load fast, but you don&#8217;t need AMP for fast-loading web pages. If you are a publisher and your web pages don&#8217;t load fast, the sane solution is to <a href=\"http://idlewords.com/amp_static.html\">fix your fucking website so that pages load fast</a>, not to throw your hands up in the air and implement AMP.</p>\n\n<p>But other than loading fast, AMP <em>sucks</em>. It implements its own scrolling behavior on iOS, which feels unnatural, and even worse, it breaks the decade-old system-wide iOS behavior of being able to tap the status bar to scroll to the top of any scrollable view. AMP also completely breaks Safari&#8217;s ability to search for text on a page (via the &#8220;Find on Page&#8221; action in the sharing sheet). Google has no respect for the platform. If I had my way, Mobile Safari would refuse to render AMP pages. It&#8217;s a deliberate effort by Google to break the open web.</p>\n\n<div>\n<a  title=\"Permanent link to ‘Scott Gilbertson: &#8216;Kill Google AMP Before It Kills the Web&#8217;’\"  href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2017/05/20/gilbertson-amp\">&nbsp;★&nbsp;</a>\n</div>\n\n\t"

But the Global Seed Vault, buried\nin a mountain deep inside the Arctic circle, has been breached\nafter global warming produced extraordinary temperatures over the\nwinter, sending meltwater gushing into the entrance tunnel.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The big takeaway from this should be that climate change truly is a threat to civilization. But, I have to say, that melting permafrost wasn&#8217;t taken into consideration during the design of this vault seems like a glaring oversight.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Update:</strong> Looks like The Guardian might have shamelessly sensationalized this story. <a href=\"http://www.popsci.com/seed-vault-flooding?src=SOC&amp;dom=tw#page-3\">Mary Beth Griggs, reporting for Popular Science</a>:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>“If there was a worst case scenario where there was so much water,\nor the pumping systems failed, that it made its way uphill to the\nseed vault, then it would encounter minus 18 [degrees celsius] and\nfreeze again. Then there’s another barrier [the ice] for entry\ninto the seed vault,” Fowler says. In other words, any water that\nfloods into the tunnel has to make it 100 meters downhill, then\nback uphill, then overwhelm the pumping systems, and then manage\nnot to freeze at well-below-freezing temperatures. Otherwise,\nthere&#8217;s no way liquid is getting into the seed bank &#8212; so the\nseeds are probably safe. [&#8230;]</p>\n\n<p>Still worried? Maybe this will help you exhale: “We did this\ncalculation; if all the ice in the world melted &#8212; Greenland,\nArctic, Antarctic, everything &#8212; and then we had the world&#8217;s\nlargest recorded tsunami right in front of the seed vault. So,\nvery high sea levels and the worlds largest Tsunami. What would\nhappen to the seed vault?” Fowler says. “We found that the seed\nvault was somewhere between a five and seven story building above\nthat point. It might not help the road leading up to the seed\nvault, but the seeds themselves would be OK.&#8221;</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Sounds like the vault itself <em>is</em> designed to survive a climate apocalypse &#8212; it&#8217;s just the entry that isn&#8217;t.</p>\n\n<div>\n<a  title=\"Permanent link to ‘Arctic Stronghold of World’s Seeds Flooded After Permafrost Melts’\"  href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2017/05/20/global-seed-vault\">&nbsp;★&nbsp;</a>\n</div>\n\n\t"

As I’ve argued repeatedly in my column, they are\nalso becoming the most powerful companies of any kind, essentially\ninescapable for any consumer or business that wants to participate\nin the modern world.

If an evil monarch forced you to choose, in\nwhat order would you give up these inescapable giants of tech?</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Great question. I love thought exercises.</p>\n\n<p>My order (from first dropped to last):</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li><p>Facebook. I love Instagram, but could live without it. I don&#8217;t use anything else Facebook offers.</p></li>\n<li><p>Microsoft. The only Microsoft product I use regularly is Skype, for podcasting, and I suspect I could find another solution. (If I couldn&#8217;t, I might have to rethink my answer here.)</p></li>\n<li><p>Amazon. I buy stuff from Amazon almost every week. I just counted &#8212; 11 orders so far in 2017. My wife buys stuff from Amazon even more frequently. But just about anything we buy at Amazon, we <em>could</em> buy elsewhere. It&#8217;d be painful to replace, but not irreplaceable. There are a couple of shows exclusive to Amazon Prime that I enjoy, but none that I love.</p></li>\n<li><p>Alphabet. I already use DuckDuckGo as my default search engine, so giving up Google search would be frustrating at times, but not a deal breaker. I use a few email accounts backed by Gmail, but I actually dislike Gmail, and have been procrastinating on moving all my mail to <a href=\"https://www.fastmail.com/\">FastMail</a> for years. I despise Google Docs. I don&#8217;t use any Android devices other than as a curiosity. I greatly prefer Safari over Chrome. YouTube, however, is irreplaceable, and so essential that it pretty much singlehandedly catapults Alphabet to #4 in my list.</p></li>\n<li><p>Apple. I mean, come on. If not for Apple I&#8217;d be stuck using computers I don&#8217;t like and a phone that I consider a distant second-best. With all the other companies on the list, what I&#8217;d miss most are certain of their services &#8212; Instagram, Skype, Amazon&#8217;s store, YouTube &#8212; but Apple is the only company in the world whose hardware I consider irreplaceable. And you need the hardware to make best use of the services from any other companies. And that doesn&#8217;t even touch upon Apple&#8217;s crown jewels: the MacOS and iOS software platforms.</p></li>\n</ol>\n\n\n\n    "

         "content_html" : "\n<p><a href=\"https://stratechery.com/2017/apples-china-problem/\">Ben Thompson had a great column this week</a>, in the wake of Apple&#8217;s quarterly results and Microsoft&#8217;s announcement of the Surface Laptop:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Did you hear about the new Microsoft Surface Laptop? The <a href=\"https://twitter.com/reckless/status/859448810187235330\">usual\nsuspects</a> are claiming it’s a MacBook competitor, which is\ntrue insomuch as it is a laptop. In truth, though, the Surface\nLaptop isn’t a MacBook competitor at all for the rather obvious\nreason that it runs Windows, while the MacBook runs MacOS. This\nhas always been the foundation of Apple’s business model:\n<a href=\"https://stratechery.com/2016/everything-as-a-service/\">hardware differentiated by software</a> such that said hardware\ncan be sold with a margin much greater than nominal competitors\nrunning a commodity operating system.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Hardware differentiated by <em>superior, exclusive</em> software is the key to understanding Apple. It&#8217;s the reason the company was founded. Apple II&#8217;s were the best personal computer hardware <em>and</em> had the best software. Part of why Woz is so venerated is that he was unimaginably gifted at both hardware <em>and</em> <a href=\"http://gizmodo.com/how-steve-wozniak-wrote-basic-for-the-original-apple-fr-1570573636\">software</a>. Hardware differentiated by software is how Apple survived in the late &#8217;90s, when the company was struggling. It explains all the company&#8217;s success after that: the iPod, the resurgence of the Mac, iPhone, iPad, and Apple Watch. Any comparison between Microsoft&#8217;s Surface Laptop and Apple&#8217;s MacBooks that doesn&#8217;t place heavy emphasis on the value of MacOS is vapid.</p>\n\n<p>Thompson then turns to Apple&#8217;s languishing iPhone sales in China:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>But that is not what is going on in most of the world: plenty of\nfolks &#8212; more than last year &#8212; are happy to buy the iPhone 7,\neven though it doesn’t look much different than the iPhone 6.\nAfter all, if you need a new phone, and you want iOS, you don’t\nhave much choice! Except, again, for China: that is the country\nwhere the appearance of the iPhone matters most; Apple’s\nproblem, though, is that in China that is the only thing that\nmatters at all.</p>\n\n<p>The fundamental issue is this: unlike the rest of the world, in\nChina the most important layer of the smartphone stack is not the\nphone’s operating system. Rather, it is WeChat. Connie Chan of\nAndreessen Horowitz <a href=\"http://a16z.com/2015/08/06/wechat-china-mobile-first/\">tried to explain in 2015</a> just how integrated\nWeChat is into the daily lives of nearly <a href=\"http://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/5d6Th5wndmJT25cRHemZNg\">900 million Chinese</a>, and\nthat integration has only grown since then: every aspect of a\ntypical Chinese person’s life, not just online but also off is\nconducted through a single app (and, to the extent other apps are\nused, they are often games promoted through WeChat).</p>\n\n<p>There is nothing in any other country that is comparable: not\nLINE, not WhatsApp, not Facebook. All of those are about\ncommunication or wasting time: WeChat is that, but it is also for\nreading news, for hailing taxis, for paying for lunch (try and pay\nwith cash for lunch, and you’ll look like a luddite), for\naccessing government resources, for business. For all intents and\npurposes WeChat is your phone, and to a far greater extent in\nChina than anywhere else, your phone is everything.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>As Thompson adds in a footnote, &#8220;Or, to put it another way, the operating system of China is WeChat, not iOS/Android.&#8221;</p>\n\n<p>Thompson cites a staggering statistic: among existing iPhone users in China who bought a new phone in 2016, only 50 percent of them bought another iPhone. That is an incredible statistical outlier compared to iPhone users in the rest of the world, where Apple&#8217;s retention rates hover around the mid-80s.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.businessinsider.com/iphone-users-abandon-loyalty-to-apple-2016-11\">Here&#8217;s a Business Insider report from November of last year</a>, with retention statistics from 2014 through 2016 from UBS analysts Steven Milunovich and Benjamin Wilson. Business Insider leads with the iPhone&#8217;s slowly declining retention rate globally, but the real story is halfway down the page, in <a href=\"http://static4.businessinsider.com/image/5818d4cbdd089533548b4991-1015/screen%20shot%202016-11-01%20at%2016.29.01.png\">this chart</a>.</p>\n\n<p>According to that research from UBS, iPhone retention rates hover in the mid-to-high 80s in the U.S., U.K., and Germany. In Japan they&#8217;re in the mid-70s, but holding roughly steady. China&#8217;s numbers have plummeted &#8212; and these numbers from UBS (in the mid-50s for Q4 2016) are in line with the 50 percent number in the Chinese survey Thompson cited.</p>\n\n<p>So here&#8217;s Apple&#8217;s China problem: Chinese iPhone users aren&#8217;t nearly as loyal to the iPhone platform as iPhone users elsewhere are. This is already hurting Apple financially. Apple&#8217;s Q2 2017 financial results (announced this week) were, overall, OK. But other than China, they were actually good. The drop in iPhone sales in China was so severe, and China is so big, that it singlehandedly turned a good quarter into a so-so quarter.</p>\n\n<p>I subtly disagree with Ben Thompson on one point. Thompson attributes the iPhone&#8217;s slide in China to two factors:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>The whole &#8220;the operating system of China is WeChat, not iOS/Android&#8221; thing.</li>\n<li>The staleness of the iPhone 7 form factor.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>Thompson knows Chinese culture well &#8212; he lives in Taipei, visits China often, and speaks Mandarin. My grasp of Chinese culture is rudimentary at best, and I&#8217;ve never traveled to Asia. So I defer to him on the point that the iPhone as a status symbol is more important in China than it is elsewhere.</p>\n\n<p>Thompson, though, I think places too much weight on the fact that at a glance, some models of the iPhone 7 are indistinguishable from the iPhone 6 and 6S. Thompson argues that this is more of a problem in status-conscious China than it is elsewhere &#8212; that in China, there are many people who forego an upgrade to an iPhone 7 because other people won&#8217;t be able to tell that it isn&#8217;t, say, a boring two-year-old iPhone 6. I just don&#8217;t buy that. For one thing, the black and especially jet black iPhone 7 models <em>are</em> instantly recognizable as the latest and greatest.</p>\n\n<p>But more importantly, I just think the whole &#8220;<em>if it doesn&#8217;t have an altogether new form factor, it&#8217;s boring</em>&#8221; thing is hogwash. <a href=\"http://daringfireball.net/2016/09/design_as_branding\">I wrote an entire column about this</a> when the iPhone 7 debuted, and won&#8217;t rehash the whole argument here. But I am convinced this viewpoint is mostly that of the tech and gadget obsessed.</p>\n\n<p>Again, I&#8217;ll concede that the status symbol aspect of a high-end smartphone may well be more important in China than anywhere else in the world. But even if I also concede that the iPhone 7&#8217;s mostly-like-the-iPhone-6 form factor is a problem for the Chinese market, if the iOS platform engendered the loyalty in China that it does elsewhere, the result would be Chinese iPhone owners waiting another year for the <em>next</em> iPhone. Instead, according to the market research cited above, half of the Chinese iPhone owners who bought a new phone in 2016 switched to an Android device. There are some fine looking Android phones at the high end of the market, but there are none that, based on form factor alone, would explain this. And none of them have anything close to the luxury brand prestige that Apple does.</p>\n\n<p>In Apple&#8217;s &#8220;hardware differentiated by software&#8221; formula, the software is more important than the hardware. That&#8217;s why gadget writers so often get Apple wrong: they&#8217;re focused solely on hardware &#8212; the object, not the experience of using the object. That&#8217;s also why the financial press so often gets Apple wrong: they focus only on the hardware because that&#8217;s where the money comes from.</p>\n\n<p>If forced to choose, I would much rather run iOS on a Google Pixel than Android on an iPhone 7. I would rather run MacOS on a ThinkPad than Windows on a MacBook Pro.<sup id=\"fnr1-2017-05-05\"><a href=\"#fn1-2017-05-05\">1</a></sup> Whenever I bring up this thought experiment &#8212; would you rather run Apple&#8217;s software platform on non-Apple hardware or run some other software platform on Apple hardware &#8212; I get email from readers who say they actually do choose Apple products, especially MacBooks, for the hardware. I believe them, but those are the sort of customers with the least loyalty to Apple. If all you depend on is, say, Chrome, a text editor, and a terminal, it&#8217;s easy to switch to another laptop brand. If you depend on native Mac and iOS apps, iCloud, and iMessage, it&#8217;s arduous, at best, to switch.</p>\n\n<p>If it really is true that &#8220;the operating system of China is WeChat, not iOS/Android&#8221;, that&#8217;s the whole ballgame right there. Again, my disagreement with Thompson here is subtle. He even describes WeChat&#8217;s centrality to the Chinese smartphone stack as &#8220;the fundamental issue&#8221;, leaving the supposed boringness of the iPhone 6S and 7 as a secondary issue. My difference with Thompson is that I don&#8217;t think the iPhone 6S/7 hardware is a problem at all. Personally, I think the iPhone 7 is such a great phone, and the 7 Plus in particular has such a great camera, that the quality of the latest iPhone hardware, including how it looks, shows just how much of a problem it is that WeChat, not iOS, is central to the iPhone experience in China.</p>\n\n<p>That&#8217;s a real problem for Apple, because even if Thompson is right (and I&#8217;m wrong) and Apple <em>does</em> have a boring-looking-hardware problem in China, they can (and seem poised to) remedy that by releasing exciting new iPhone hardware this year. But if the problem is that iOS engenders far less platform loyalty in China because of WeChat&#8217;s centrality &#8212; or even worse, if WeChat is central <em>and</em> better on Android than it is on iOS &#8212; there&#8217;s no easy fix for Apple.</p>\n\n<h2>Postscript</h2>\n\n<p>For those of you like me, who know very little about WeChat, this 2015 piece by Connie Chan (as linked to by Thompson) is a terrific introduction: &#8220;<a href=\"http://a16z.com/2015/08/06/wechat-china-mobile-first/\">When One App Rules Them All: The Case of WeChat and Mobile in China</a>&#8221;.</p>\n\n<div class=\"footnotes\">\n<hr />\n<ol>\n<li id=\"fn1-2017-05-05\">\n<p>I always use ThinkPads as my go-to example of high-quality PC hardware; perhaps I should start using Microsoft Surfaces?&nbsp;<a href=\"#fnr1-2017-05-05\"  class=\"footnoteBackLink\"  title=\"Jump back to footnote 1 in the text.\">&#x21A9;&#xFE0E;</a></p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n</div>\n\n\n\n    "

Apple has never shared hard numbers on how many\nwearables it has sold, and doesn’t even break out Watch sales in\nits quarterly earnings report. Instead, the device is bundled into\nApple’s “Other products,” which the company says includes, “Apple\nTV, Apple Watch, Beats products, iPod and Apple-branded and\nthird-party accessories.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>These articles come out like clockwork every 3 months, as Apple&#8217;s earnings report draws near. Apple told us they were not going to report hard numbers on Apple Watch right from the start, six months before it shipped. They want to keep them secret for competitive reasons.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Two years and two iterations after its launch, the Apple Watch has\nnot proven to be as indispensable as the iPhone, or even as\nlucrative as the Mac, the iPad, or Apple’s services businesses.\nIt’s unclear whether an iPhone-like overhaul, or attempts to\nmarket the watch directly to athletes or millennials, will\nultimately make a difference.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>(&#8220;Two years and two iterations after its launch&#8221; &#8212; I don&#8217;t know if that&#8217;s a mistake, if Murphy is counting WatchOS releases, or if he&#8217;s counting Series 1 as a full hardware iteration. But it&#8217;s sloppy writing. Most people would surely agree that there&#8217;s been only one iteration since launch, the Series 2 watches released last September.)</p>\n\n<p>The nut of every &#8220;Apple Watch is a dud&#8221; story is the fact that it&#8217;s clearly not an iPhone-size business. But that can&#8217;t be the only measure of success. The iPhone is the biggest and most successful consumer product in the history of the world. Nothing compares to the smartphone market, and it&#8217;s possible nothing else will in our lifetimes. You and I may never again see a product as profitable as the iPhone &#8212; not just from Apple, but from any company in any industry. Or maybe we will. It&#8217;s a complete unknown.</p>\n\n<p>But if Apple gets it into its head that they should only work on iPhone-sized opportunities, it would paralyze the company. In baseball terms, it&#8217;s fine for Apple to hit a bunch of singles while waiting for their next home run. According to Apple, <a href=\"https://www.wareable.com/apple/watch-sales-rolex-tim-cook-556\">they had more watch sales by revenue in 2015 than any company other than Rolex</a>, and Apple&#8217;s &#8220;Other&#8221; category, which is where Watch sales are accounted for, <a href=\"https://images.apple.com/pr/pdf/q1fy17datasum.pdf\">had a near record-breaking holiday quarter</a> three months ago, suggesting strongly that Watch sales were up over the year-ago holiday quarter.</p>\n\n<p>These two facts are both true: Apple Watch sales are a rounding error compared to the iPhone, and Apple Watch is a smash hit compared to traditional watches and other wearable devices.</p>\n\n\n\n    "

The reason? So Apple would not find out\nthat Uber had been secretly identifying and tagging iPhones even\nafter its app had been deleted and the devices erased &#8212; a fraud\ndetection maneuver that violated Apple’s privacy guidelines.</p>\n\n<p>But Apple was on to the deception, and when Mr. Kalanick arrived\nat the midafternoon meeting sporting his favorite pair of bright\nred sneakers and hot-pink socks, Mr. Cook was prepared. “So, I’ve\nheard you’ve been breaking some of our rules,” Mr. Cook said in\nhis calm, Southern tone. Stop the trickery, Mr. Cook then\ndemanded, or Uber’s app would be kicked out of Apple’s App Store.</p>\n\n<p>For Mr. Kalanick, the moment was fraught with tension. If Uber’s\napp was yanked from the App Store, it would lose access to\nmillions of iPhone customers &#8212; essentially destroying the\nride-hailing company’s business. So Mr. Kalanick acceded.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>&#8220;Secretly identifying and tagging iPhones even after its app had been deleted and the devices erased&#8221; is a rather startling accusation, because it sounds like it should be technically impossible. It&#8217;s also very much unclear what information Uber was able to glean from these &#8220;identified and tagged&#8221; iPhones other than some sort of unique device identifier. Unfortunately, the Times story is very short on details here. But note that the Times is <em>not</em> saying Uber was &#8220;tracking&#8221; these phones. A lot of people are jumping to the conclusion that Uber was somehow tracking the location of users even after they deleted the Uber app, but the word &#8220;track&#8221; only appears in the article in the context of Kalanick having &#8220;excelled at running track and playing football&#8221; in high school.</p>\n\n<p>[<strong>Update:</strong> This explains a lot, regarding the hubbub today over this story. <a href=\"http://newsdiffs.org/diff/1383350/1383404/https%3A/www.nytimes.com/2017/04/23/technology/travis-kalanick-pushes-uber-and-himself-to-the-precipice.html\">When first published, the Times story <em>did</em> use the word &#8220;tracking&#8221;</a>, but a subsequent revision changed that word to &#8220;identifying and tagging&#8221;.]</p>\n\n<p>Reading between the lines, it is possible &#8212; and my gut says quite probable &#8212; that Uber wasn&#8217;t <em>doing</em> anything on these iPhones other than when its app was installed and running on them. From the end of the article:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>The idea of fooling Apple, the main distributor of Uber’s app,\nbegan in 2014.</p>\n\n<p>At the time, Uber was dealing with widespread account fraud in\nplaces like China, where tricksters bought stolen iPhones that\nwere erased of their memory and resold. Some Uber drivers there\nwould then create dozens of fake email addresses to sign up for\nnew Uber rider accounts attached to each phone, and request rides\nfrom those phones, which they would then accept. Since Uber was\nhanding out incentives to drivers to take more rides, the drivers\ncould earn more money this way.</p>\n\n<p>To halt the activity, Uber engineers assigned a persistent\nidentity to iPhones with a small piece of code, a practice called\n“fingerprinting.” Uber could then identify an iPhone and prevent\nitself from being fooled even after the device was erased of its\ncontents.</p>\n\n<p>There was one problem: Fingerprinting iPhones broke Apple’s rules.\nMr. Cook believed that wiping an iPhone should ensure that no\ntrace of the owner’s identity remained on the device.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>What Isaac is reporting here doesn&#8217;t require any code running on an iPhone other than when the Uber app is itself installed and launched. I&#8217;m speculating here, but it could be something like this:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li><p>The Uber app, while installed, fingerprints the device somehow, and reports the fingerprint home to Uber&#8217;s servers, where it is tied to the user&#8217;s Uber account. (All iPhones have a Unique Device Identifier &#8212; &#8220;UDID&#8221; &#8212; but <a href=\"http://lifehacker.com/5898282/what-a-udid-is-and-why-apples-rejecting-apps-that-want-yours\">Apple banned third-party apps from accessing it in 2012</a>. Uber either found a way to access UDIDs surreptitiously, or created some other way of uniquely identifying devices even after they&#8217;ve been wiped. It would be good to know exactly what they did, but for the sake of my argument here it doesn&#8217;t matter.)</p></li>\n<li><p>The Uber app is deleted from the device and/or device is wiped. At this point, Uber knows the fingerprint for the device, but can’t use it to track the device in any way, <em>and they don’t care</em>, because until someone reinstalls the Uber app on the phone it isn&#8217;t being used to book fraudulent rides.</p></li>\n<li><p>The Uber app is reinstalled on the iPhone. When it launches, it does the fingerprint check and phones home again. Uber now knows this is the same iPhone they’ve seen before, because the fingerprint matches. This is the violation of Apple&#8217;s privacy policy.</p></li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>But until step 3, when the Uber app is reinstalled, I don&#8217;t think Uber was &#8220;tracking&#8221; the phone in any way. And they didn’t care — the Times says the whole project was designed to counter fraud in China, which required the Uber app to be reinstalled on stolen iPhones.</p>\n\n<p>Repeating from the opening of the article, Isaac wrote:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>So Apple would not find out that Uber had been secretly\nidentifying and tagging iPhones even after its app had been\ndeleted and the devices erased &#8212; a fraud detection maneuver that\nviolated Apple’s privacy guidelines.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>That <em>sounds</em> like Uber was doing the identifying and &#8220;tagging&#8221; (whatever that is) after the app had been deleted and/or the device wiped, but I think what it might &#8212; <em>might</em> &#8212; actually mean is merely that the identification persisted after the app had been deleted and/or the device wiped. That&#8217;s not supposed to be technically possible &#8212; iOS APIs for things like the UDID and even the MAC address stopped reporting unique identifiers years ago, because they were being abused by privacy invasive ad trackers, analytics packages, and entitled shitbags like Uber. That&#8217;s wrong, and Apple was right to put an end to it, but it&#8217;s far less sensational than the prospect of Uber having been able to identify and &#8220;tag&#8221; an iPhone <em>after</em> the Uber app had been deleted. The latter scenario only seems technically possible if other third-party apps were executing surreptitious code that did this stuff through Uber&#8217;s SDK, or if the Uber app left behind malware outside the app&#8217;s sandbox. I don&#8217;t think that&#8217;s the case, if only because I don&#8217;t think Apple would have hesitated to remove Uber from the App Store if it was infecting iPhones with hidden phone-home malware.</p>\n\n<p>The article does raise some questions:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p>What APIs and device info was Uber using to identify iPhones? Are these API loopholes now closed in iOS? If we don&#8217;t learn exactly what Uber was using to identify devices, we cannot know that the technique no longer works. iOS users should be able to feel confident that when they delete an app, all connections between their device and the developer of the app are disconnected, and that when they wipe a device, everything personally identifying has been removed from it.</p></li>\n<li><p>What exactly did Apple know about Uber&#8217;s actions in this regard when Tim Cook called Kalanick in for the meeting? Was Apple aware that Uber was specifically keeping a database of unique iPhone identifiers? If so, how?</p></li>\n<li><p>What prompted Apple to investigate Uber in this regard? And why did Uber suspect Apple was going to investigate, prompting them to geofence their fingerprinting so it wouldn&#8217;t trigger in Cupertino? (My theory: the Uber app was calling private APIs, and they used the geofence to avoid calling those private APIs while the app was in App Store review, assuming, perhaps incorrectly, that all App Store reviewers work in Cupertino. App Store review can identify apps that call private APIs.)</p></li>\n<li><p><strong>Update</strong>: Why didn&#8217;t Apple require Uber to disclose what they’d done as a condition for remaining in the store? Shouldn&#8217;t iPhone users who had Uber installed know about this?</p></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>[<strong>Update 2:</strong> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/chronic/status/856250223777206273\">Will Strafach examined a 2014 build of the Uber iOS app</a> and found them using private APIs to use IOKit to pull the device serial number from the device registry. There might be more, but this alone is a blatant violation of App Store policy. <a href=\"https://twitter.com/chronic/status/856333895050178560\">Strafach confirms</a> that the technique Uber was using no longer works in iOS 10.]</p>\n\n<hr />\n\n<p>The article also contains this non-Apple-related tidbit:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Uber devoted teams to so-called competitive intelligence,\npurchasing data from an analytics service called Slice\nIntelligence. Using an email digest service it owns named\nUnroll.me, Slice collected its customers’ emailed Lyft receipts\nfrom their inboxes and sold the anonymized data to Uber. Uber used\nthe data as a proxy for the health of Lyft’s business. (Lyft, too,\noperates a competitive intelligence team.)</p>\n\n<p>Slice confirmed that it sells anonymized data (meaning that\ncustomers’ names are not attached) based on ride receipts from\nUber and Lyft, but declined to disclose who buys the information.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>This is, needless to say, super shitty. We expect it from Uber. But Slice should be ashamed of themselves. Their <a href=\"https://unroll.me/\">Unroll.me</a> service is billed as a tool to &#8220;Clean up your inbox&#8221; by identifying subscription emails and allowing you to unsubscribe from them in bulk. It&#8217;s &#8220;free&#8221; in the sense that you don&#8217;t pay them money, but they&#8217;re selling your personal information to companies like Uber. Supposedly that information is anonymized, but wiped iPhones are supposed to be anonymized too, and Uber found at least one route around that. </p>\n\n\n\n    "
